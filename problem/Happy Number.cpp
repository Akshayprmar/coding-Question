/*

Check whether a number is a happy number, and print the first k happy numbers from this number.

A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, 
and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. 
Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers, while those that do not end in 1 are unhappy numbers.

If a number is happy, then all members of its sequence are happy; if a number is unhappy, all members of the sequence are unhappy.

/*

solution:  if we get 1ï¼Œreturn true, cache the middle number, if we get previous visited number, 
return false (because a cycle occurs, and you can't get to 1 forever.)

Proof for the sequence must get smaller.
Suppose the number gets to n digits, next number is less than

9^2 * n = 81 * n 

this is strictly less than the number itself, which is greater than
10^(n - 1)
when n gets greater or equal than 4

so the number will decrease after operation

no possible to overflow
