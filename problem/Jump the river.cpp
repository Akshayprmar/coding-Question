/*

A 0/1 array R stands for the river，0 stands for water，1 stands for rock。The start position is R[0](value:1)
The initial speed is 1. At each step, you can choose the current speed or increase current speed by 1。You can
only stand at the rock, calculate the minimal steps to jump the river.

Suppose R=[1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0]，at least 3 steps：
First step:increase speed to 2，jump to R[2],
Second step: increase spped to 3，jump to R[5],
Third step: keep speed 3，jump out of array, success.
