I was asked by github staff to remove the code because it SEEMS that the content is from some unknown code test website.

If you google the K-complementary title, the code is everywhere. A lot of websites or personal blogs have this kind of code. 

I provided my analysis and test cases here which suddenly becomes the property of some UNKNOWN website. You must be kidding me!

Honestly, what kind of stupid guy would use that UNKNOWN website!
